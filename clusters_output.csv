21/11/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am submitting this formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against Experian for failing to adequately address and correct an inaccurate late payment mark on my credit report : account : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX The circumstances surrounding this delay were entirely beyond my control and were caused by procedural failures on the part of the creditor. Despite disputing this late payment with Experian and providing substantial evidence to support my claim, the bureau has failed to properly investigate and correct this inaccurate reporting. 
Erroneous Late Payment Reporting : The late payment mark reported on my credit file stems from the following situation : Prior to the payment due date, my account experienced a fraudulent transaction, which I promptly disputed with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The unresolved dispute led to a block on my account, preventing me from accessing it to make a timely payment. 
The payment was made on XX/XX/year>, immediately after XXXX XXXX resolved the issue. 
The delay in payment was entirely caused by XXXX XXXX failure to act promptly to address the fraudulent transaction and unblock my account. This late payment does not reflect my financial responsibility or payment behavior. 
Experians Failure to Investigate : Despite submitting a formal dispute to Experian with clear evidence demonstrating the inaccuracy of this late payment mark, Experian has failed to properly investigate and correct the information as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Instead, the inaccurate late payment remains on my credit report, causing significant damage to my credit score and financial standing. 
Harm to My Financial Standing : This inaccurate late payment mark has caused unnecessary harm to my credit score, jeopardizing my ability to secure financing for my business. It is unjust for this negative mark to persist on my report due to failures by both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Experian to fulfill their legal obligations. 
Legal Violations by Experian Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Investigation ( FCRA, Section 1681i ) : Experian is required to conduct a reasonable investigation of disputes submitted by consumers. The bureau failed to thoroughly investigate my claim, disregarding the evidence I provided that clearly demonstrated the inaccuracy of the late payment.

Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy ( FCRA, Section 607 ( b ) ) : Experian has a legal obligation to ensure that all information on a consumers credit report is accurate. By failing to address this dispute, the bureau is perpetuating inaccurate information on my credit file. 
Negligence in Verifying Information Provided by the Creditor ( FCRA, Section 1681s-2 ( b ) ) : Experian is obligated to verify the accuracy of the information furnished by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This obligation includes ensuring that any negative marks reported are accurate and substantiated. 
By failing to correct this inaccuracy, Experian is violating my rights under the FCRA, causing undue harm to my financial reputation. 
The inaccurate late payment mark on my credit report is unjust, harmful, and violates my rights under the FCRA. I urge the CFPB to investigate Experians handling of my dispute and ensure that this matter is resolved promptly and fairly.

More than XXXX years ago, Wayfair Card Services canceled my account with a balance of only {$500.00}. Since then, I have made consistent payments toward the balance. However, the company continues to add exorbitant amounts of interest, making it nearly impossible to pay off the account.

These actions are not only predatory but also violate my rights as a consumer. Specifically : Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, creditors are prohibited from applying unfair or excessive charges, particularly when a good faith effort has been made to resolve the balance. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, creditors are required to report accurate and fair information to credit reporting agencies. The late payment reports are erroneous and detrimental to my credit history. 
I kindly request that the CFPB investigate Wayfair Card Services practices and intervene to ensure compliance with federal laws. Additionally, I respectfully request that this account be removed from my credit report to prevent further financial harm, as their practices have made it unjustly impossible for me to resolve this matter.

06/02/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"I am writing to lodge a formal complaint against United Wholesale Mortgage ( UWM ), an escrow service provider, for serious mismanagement of my escrow account and mortgage payments, leading to substantial financial harm and the risk of losing my home. Despite multiple attempts to resolve these issues directly with UWM, their persistent negligence and failure to adhere to explicit instructions necessitate regulatory intervention. 

In XXXX, due to financial hardships exacerbated by the pandemic, I enrolled in a tax relief program to manage my property tax payments. Despite informing UWM of this arrangement and explicitly instructing them not to make tax payments from my escrow, UWM disregarded this directive, leading to unnecessary withdrawals for taxes, late fees, and penalties. It took extensive communication and the threat of reporting their actions before UWM partially refunded the overpayments. 

In the subsequent year, amid ongoing financial difficulties, I was accepted into a mortgage relief program. I provided UWM with all requisite documentation and repeatedly confirmed, including through multiple phone calls, that my mortgage payments should not be made through the escrow during this relief period. Contrary to these explicit instructions and documented agreements, UWM made unauthorized payments, jeopardizing my financial stability and placing my home at imminent risk of foreclosure. 

Furthermore, the mortgage relief program disbursed over {$32000.00} to bring my account current and assist with my hardship, yet UWM failed to apply these funds as intended. Despite assurances that my account was current, I later received notifications of delinquency without clarity on the application of the over {$32000.00}. My requests for a thorough investigation and account review have been met with indifference, with each interaction marred by a lack of continuity and accountability from UWM 's representatives. 

This pattern of behavior by UWM demonstrates a blatant disregard for consumer rights and financial regulations, warranting a comprehensive review by your agency. The financial and emotional toll of UWM 's actions, coupled with the looming threat of foreclosure, underscores the urgency of this matter. 

I request your agency 's immediate intervention to investigate these grievances, ensure UWM 's compliance with applicable financial regulations, and mandate appropriate corrective actions to remedy the harm caused. Enclosed are copies of all relevant communications, documents, and evidence supporting my complaint. 

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. I am willing to provide further information as needed and look forward to your prompt response.

With that said, I deny your allegations and I challenge you to provide proof that you have the right to report this incomplete negative information on my credit report. 

Per 15 U.S.C 1681e Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

According to 12 CFR Part 1022 ( Regulation V ) requires furnishers to : Furnish information concerning accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity.

Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate.

C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes According to XXXX, in order to make a lawful report, you must follow the Metro 2 compliance standards. 

Also as stated in the XXXX Any Deviation From These Standards Jeopardizes The Integrity of The Data. This means that any mistakes in reporting claims can make the information less accurate and it affects the accuracy of any federally regulated reports. 

Therefore, I am invoking my rights to challenge these inaccurate and non-compliant items. Neglecting my demand will only prove that you DO NOT care about my rights as a consumer. Its NOT FAIR for you to report information that isnt confirmed to be ethical and meets the standards of certified reporting. Again, I am challenging these claims and asking for proof of the proper reporting standards.

Despite multiple requests for correction, including dispute letters sent on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, the erroneous late payment information has not been corrected. This ongoing inaccuracy violates provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and the Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ). 
Discrepancies : Last Verified : Only TransUnion has a last verified date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not list one. 
Date of Last Activity : Only TransUnion lists a date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not list one. 
Date Reported : All bureaus list differing dates ( TransUnion : XX/XX/year> ; XXXX : XX/XX/year> ; XXXX : XX/XX/year> ). 
Closed Date : Only TransUnion lists a closed date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not. 
Account Rating : All bureaus list the account as closed, but only TransUnion provides a specific closed date. 
Two-Year Payment History : TransUnion : XXXX late payment reported for XX/XX/year>. 
XXXX : XXXX late payment reported for XX/XX/year>. 
XXXX : XXXX late payment reported for XX/XX/year>. 
Violations : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i, credit reporting agencies are required to ensure the accuracy of the information they report. The continued presence of inaccurate late payment entries on my credit report demonstrates non-compliance with this mandate. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : According to 15 U.S.C. 1666b, creditors must provide periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate reporting of late payments suggests a failure to comply with this requirement.

Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) : Creditors are obligated to ensure timely and accurate statements to avoid unfair penalties to consumers. The erroneous late payment information violates this responsibility. 
Evidence of Error : Payment History : Documentation from XXXX XXXX confirms no late payments were made on this account for the periods in question. 
Prior Disputes : Attached copies of my previous dispute letters dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, along with proof of submission. 
Account Statements : Monthly statements from XXXX XXXX confirming on-time payments for XXXX and XX/XX/year>. 
Discrepancies : Last Verified : Only TransUnion has a last verified date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not list one. 
Date of Last Activity : Only TransUnion lists a date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not list one. 
Date Reported : All bureaus list differing dates ( TransUnion : XX/XX/year> ; XXXX : XX/XX/year> ; XXXX : XX/XX/year> ). 
Closed Date : Only TransUnion lists a closed date ( XX/XX/year> ) ; XXXX and XXXX do not. 
Account Rating : All bureaus list the account as closed, but only TransUnion provides a specific closed date. 
Desired Resolution : Immediate removal of all inaccurate late payment notations from my credit report across TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX. 
Written confirmation of the corrections made to my credit file. 
Failure to resolve this issue promptly will result in further escalation, including additional complaints and potential legal action.

06/02/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), outlined in 15 USC 1681, it is imperative that consumer reporting agencies uphold their responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a deep regard for consumer privacy, as stated in 15 USC 1681 section 602 ( a ). XXXX, Experian, and XXXX function as consumer reporting agencies, while I am the Consumer. My right to safeguard my private information from dissemination is supported by 15 USC 6801, which underscores the obligation of financial institutions, including ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ), to respect customer privacy and safeguard nonpublic personal information.

Referring to 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ), section 2, it is established that any consumer reporting agency may only furnish a consumer report with the written instructions of the concerned consumer. Both ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ), the financial institution, and the consumer reporting agencies, XXXX, Experian, and XXXX, lack my consent, which includes verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or any other form, and I hereby revoke any and all such consent. 

According to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ), a financial institution can not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party without providing the consumer an explanation of how to exercise the nondisclosure option. Unfortunately, ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) never informed me of my right to exercise this option.

Moreover, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) explicitly prohibits consumer reporting agencies from including adverse items of information in consumer reports without authorization. This account, reported as an adverse item without my permission, violates this provision.

Under 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ), it is unlawful to furnish inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies. XXXX, Experian, and XXXX are failing to maintain reasonable procedures in line with this requirement. 

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to avoid violations of section 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b. XXXX, Experian, and XXXX are not adhering to these standards.

With that said, I deny your allegations and I challenge you to provide proof that you have the right to report this incomplete negative information on my credit report. 

Per 15 U.S.C 1681e Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

According to 12 CFR Part 1022 ( Regulation V ) requires furnishers to : Furnish information concerning accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity.

Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate.

C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes According to CRRG, in order to make a lawful report, you must follow the Metro 2 compliance standards.

Also as stated in the CRRG Any Deviation From These Standards Jeopardizes The Integrity of The Data. This means that any mistakes in reporting claims can make the information less accurate and it affects the accuracy of any federally regulated reports. 

Therefore, I am invoking my rights to challenge these inaccurate and non-compliant items. Neglecting my demand will only prove that you DO NOT care about my rights as a consumer. Its NOT FAIR for you to report information that isnt confirmed to be ethical and meets the standards of certified reporting. Again, I am challenging these claims and asking for proof of the proper reporting standards. 

You are violating my rights! I have listed the concerns about your reporting in this document. It's not complete and does not meet my standards according to law, you must certify all aspects of required FCRA/ Metro 2 compliance which is done truthfully, correctly ( in a timely manner ), completely AND accurately as well - or else I would have to escalate these issues to the CFPB XXXX FTC and my Attorney General.

As the consumer in question, I assert my right to safeguard my private information against sharing, supported by the provision in 15 USC 6801. This section underscores the Congressional policy that each financial institution, including ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ), has a continuous obligation to respect customer privacy and ensure the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information. 

Referring to 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ), section 2, it is stipulated that any consumer reporting agency may only furnish a consumer report in accordance with the written instructions of the concerned consumer. Both ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ), the financial institution, and the consumer reporting agencies, XXXX, and Experian, lack my consent, which encompasses verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or any other form, and I hereby revoke any and all such consent. 

In accordance with 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ), a financial institution is barred from disclosing nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how they can exercise the nondisclosure option. Unfortunately, ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) never informed me of my right to exercise this option. 

Moreover, 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) explicitly prohibits consumer reporting agencies from making any consumer report containing adverse items of information without authorization. This account, reported as an adverse item without my permission, is in direct violation of this provision.

Under 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ), it is stated that a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. XXXX and Experian are not maintaining reasonable procedures in line with this requirement. 

Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that every consumer reporting agency maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b. XXXX and Experian are not currently adhering to these standards.

EXPERIAN ALSO ENGAGES IN THIS BEHAVIOR BECUASE THEY HAVE INSERTED THIS FRAUD ACCOUNT ON MY CREDIT REPORT Texas law gives someone a certain amount of time to bring a lawsuit for an unpaid debt. This time period is often commonly referred to as the statute of limitations.

Once the time period set out by the statute of limitations is up, a person is prohibited from filing suit to recover the debt. This means the debt is time-barred. 

In the past, taking certain actions such as making a payment or verbally acknowledging that you owe the debt could restart the clock on the limitations period. This created a problem called zombie debt where the time period set out by the statute of limitations could be constantly restarted. 

A new state law introduced in XXXX aims to protect people from zombie debt. This law prevents debt buyers from suing to try to collect the debt even if a payment is made on the debt after the statute of limitations has expired. It also requires debt buyers to provide written notice if they are taking action past the limitations period. Debt buyers are defined by Section XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX as a person who purchases a consumers debt from a creditor. Please see the statute for a full definition. 

You still owe time-barred debts, but creditors and debt buyers lose their most powerful way of collecting a lawsuit.

Texas and Federal Law Section 16.004 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code The statute of limitations on debt in Texas is four years.

Section 392.307 of the Texas Finance Code This section of the law, introduced in XXXX, states that a payment on the debt ( or any other activity ) does not restart the clock on the statute of limitations for debt buyers. It also requires that debt buyers provide written notice to a consumer if the limitations period has expired. 
Title 12, Section 1006.26 of the Code of Federal Regulations New rules from the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau prevent debt collectors from suing or threatening to sue over time-barred debts. Debt collectors in this code are defined in section 1006.2 ( i ) and can include the original creditor if they are using a different name.

AND Texas Laws Against Aggressive Debt Collection When it comes to debt collection, consumers have a variety of options to protect themselves against unlawful debt collectors. A XXXX law in Texas strengthened the rights of consumers against debt collection and maintained the states short statute of limitations. A Texas statute of limitations on debt is the amount of time a company or person has to pursue legal action against another. If enough time has passed, then the statute of limitations means that companies can no longer sue people for their debts. Luckily, Texas has laws on the books to protect people against debt and the laws are in the favor of the consumer. With the help of an attorney, there are ways to overcome these lawsuits and defeat the creditors. 

When people receive letters or summons in the mail about an old unpaid debt, it can inspire fear and panic. A person in debt may still be in a position where they are unable to resolve the debt and the collection attempts can bring up trauma. In the case of old debts, or what some people call zombie debts because of how debt collectors never ceased to collect on them, companies can still aggressively attempt to collect on the debt. However, as a response to this, many states like Texas implement a statute of limitations to protect citizens who can not pay or do not want to pay the debt collector. 

What is the Texas Statue of Limitations?

The Statute of Limitations is a Texas law that states that if you owe unpaid debt such as credit card debt or consumer debt, the collector only has four years to bring a debt collection lawsuit against you. Bringing a Debt Lawsuit in a Texas Court is the debtor collectors strongest method for collecting. So removing this option for the creditor is significant. 

This Texas law is governed by Section XXXX of the Texas XXXX XXXX and Remedies Code. When you have a credit card, you have a contract with the credit card company where you promise to pay the credit card company. A written contract is not required. So if you stop paying the credit card, the credit card company can file a lawsuit against you to collect the debt under the theory of breach of contract. However, if the debt collector does not file a lawsuit within four years of the breach of contract, then they can not file the lawsuit to collect the debt. This debt is now known as time-barred debt. If the creditor files a lawsuit against you after the four years, they are violating the Texas Debt Collection Law, and you can initiate retaliatory legal action, and have a strong case for getting the lawsuit dismissed.

What Is Time Barred Debt? 
Time-barred debt is debt that can not be collected through legal action anymore due to the expiration of the 4-year statute of limitations. The creditor can still attempt to collect the debt and report it on your credit report, but they can not bring a lawsuit against you and so they can not obtain a Judgement against you either.

The company can no longer threaten to sue you and forcibly collect the old debt through a lawsuit before you can organize your finances. In essence, the bank can not force you to settle the debt before you are ready and can not drag an individual into court when it is clear the individual can not pay. 

Avoiding Illegal Collection Restarts It is also important to remember that this XXXX law also included a Section that introduced the idea of time-barred debt. Once the statute of limitations has passed on the debt in Texas, then collectors can not chase consumers for it. The old debts are considered time-barred, which means that they are off-limits. In some states, companies abuse their consumers by frightening the individuals into promising to pay their debts or even acknowledging the debts. This is a trick to allow the company the right to restart the clock on collections and continue harassing the person into payment. They call this zombie debt.

Luckily, Texas law contains provisions that outlaw companies from restarting the debt. Even if you attempt to pay the debt at one time, they can no longer threaten you with legal action. Although you may still owe the debt on the books unless you file for bankruptcy or settle with the company, they lose their most powerful weapon of intimidation thanks to powerful Texas laws that protect vulnerable consumers. 

How Do You Calculate The Statute Of Limitations? 
The statute of limitations is XXXX years since the date of the breach of the contract. So when does this breach actually happen? As a rule of thumb, the date of breach is about 30 days after the last time you paid the debt. 

To illustrate this, lets say you have a credit card bill where the minimum payment is due on the first day of each month. You pay your XX/XX/XXXX minimum payment and you are current on your credit card bill. Then you do not make your XX/XX/XXXX and all future subsequent payments. Your last payment was XX/XX/XXXX, but you did not breach your contract until at least XX/XX/XXXX when you missed your first credit card payment. So if a client presented these facts to me, I would advise them that the statute of limitations clock did not start counting until at least XX/XX/XXXX. When it is a close call like this, you should really get your ducks in a row by pulling your credit report and reviewing it to determine your last payment.

AND What Debt Collectors Cant Do Debt collectors are regulated by the Texas Debt Collection Act. Among other things, the Act prohibits debt collectors from : Using abusive collection tactics, including : threatening violence or other criminal acts using profane or obscene language falsely accusing the consumer of fraud or other crimes threatening arrest of the consumer, or repossession or other XXXX of property without proper court proceedings using the telephone to harass debtors by calling anonymously or making repeated or continuous calls making collect telephone calls without disclosing the true name of the caller before the charges are accepted Using fraudulent collection tactics, including : using a false name or identification misrepresenting the amount of the debt or its judicial status sending documents to a debtor that falsely appear to be from a court or other official agency failing to identify who holds the debt misrepresenting the nature of the services rendered by the collection agency or the collector falsely representing that the collector has information or something of value in order to discover information about the consumer Trying to collect more than the amount originally agreed upon. ( But remember : your debt can grow by the addition of fees e.g., collection fees, attorney fees, etc. ). 
Violators of the Texas Debt Collection Act are subject to criminal and civil penalties. If you think you have been harassed or deceived, you can even seek injunctions and damages against debt collectors.

How do I plan to manage my receivables etc questions that you will ask if you asking for money. I felt very targeted because none of this was stated on the website or stated in the qualification section to open a checking account. I brought in all the documentation required. My EIN LETTER, MY BUSINESS certificate, my foreign entity, and so forth, she made me feel very uncomfortable as if I did not belong there, however she did open my account I was able to log in and deposit about {$1000.00} in my account however 2 days later when I tired to log in again on my phone it said my account is restricted. When I called the bank they said my account is restricted because I did not turn in my documents are you serious?

06/02/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Ive noticed that several deviations from mandatory reporting standards therefore the data in my report can not be accurate and complete! With that said, I deny your allegations and I challenge you to provide proof that you have the right to report this incomplete negative information on my credit report. 

Per 15 U.S.C 1681e Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

According to 12 CFR Part 1022 ( Regulation V ) requires furnishers to : Furnish information concerning accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity.

Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate.

C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes According to CRRG, in order to make a lawful report, you must follow the Metro 2 compliance standards.

Also as stated in the CRRG Any Deviation From These Standards Jeopardizes The Integrity of The Data. This means that any mistakes in reporting claims can make the information less accurate and it affects the accuracy of any federally regulated reports. 

Therefore, I am invoking my rights to challenge these inaccurate and non-compliant items. Neglecting my demand will only prove that you DO NOT care about my rights as a consumer. Its NOT FAIR for you to report information that isnt confirmed to be ethical and meets the standards of certified reporting. Again, I am challenging these claims and asking for proof of the proper reporting standards. 

You are violating my rights! I have listed the concerns about your reporting in this document. It's not complete and does not meet my standards according to law, you must certify all aspects of required FCRA/ Metro 2 compliance which is done truthfully, correctly ( in a timely manner ), completely AND accurately as well - or else I would have to escalate these issues to the CFPB XXXX FTC and my Attorney General.

It appears that these inquiries were made without my written consent, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681b.

The FCRA outlines permissible purposes for consumer reports, and one of these purposes, as stated in 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ), is to furnish a consumer report in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. Furthermore, under P.L 90-321 ( 82 Stat. 146 ), which supports the FCRA, stricter provisions are in place to ensure that consumer reports are only obtained in response to specific requests authorized by certain government agencies.

I have not provided written consent for these inquiries, nor have I authorized any entity to request my credit report for the purposes for which these inquiries were made. As such, it appears that XXXX, TransUnion, and XXXX have violated the FCRA by furnishing my consumer report without my written instructions or consent. 

I would also like to bring your attention to the Privacy Act of 1974, particularly 5 U.S. Code 552a ( 4 ), which defines the term "" record '' as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual maintained by an agency. This includes, but is not limited to, information about the individual 's education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history.

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to address these unauthorized inquiries. Enclosed with this letter, you will find copies of relevant documents, including my credit report reflecting the unauthorized inquiries.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take the necessary steps to ensure that my rights under the FCRA are protected.

06/02/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing to file a complaint regarding ongoing issues with the reporting of a collections account by XXXX XXXX XXXX, Experian, and XXXX. Having disputed this account since last year, and a minimum of fifteen attemps. XXXX has removed the account, but Experian and XXXX have not conducted thorough investigations, and I suspect multiple violations of proper procedures. 

The account was from a XXXX XXXX credit card, where my last payment was in XX/XX/XXXX. The account was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX, and in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating it had been voluntarily disposed of in civil court. As I was a New York resident, I believe this lawsuit occurred beyond the statute of limitations. I did not receive any letters from them until XXXX and did not know about this collections. I also do not see how they have any legal authority by disposal of the case themselves. 

Even after the account 's deletion from XXXX, XXXX continues to pull my credit report, potentially violating FCRA 604 ( f ) and FCRA 619. Moreover, their constant sale/forwarding of a debt buyer account to a factoring company account, appears to be a breach of contract according to the National Consumer Assistance Plan ( NCAP ) and the agreement between CRAs to not accept any data that did not arise from a contract or agreement to pay. They were also constantly closing, opening, and switching to a "" retail '' account. 

Experian and XXXX show duplicate collection entries from XXXX, showing signs of re-aging. XXXX displays entirely fabricated, false payments, a missed payment, then current again, and constantly changing the "" date of major delinquency first reported. '' Experian does not have the FCRA XXXXmpliance/DOFD on my credit file, while XXXX places it in the future, violating the FCRA 90-day reporting requirement. 

Despite many attempts to fix these issues, Experian denies duplicate collection entries and the existence of the NCAP agreement. Both Experian and XXXX claim they lack the legal authority to correct or remove inaccurate collections. XXXX has also removed the mandatory K1 Segment from my XXXX report, and there is no payment history from the original creditor on both agency 's. 

When my results came back from XXXX for the incorrect DOFD and false payments, it was not only verified as accurate, but XXXX themselves certified the account is being reported correctly. 

I would like to bring to your attention several of many potential violations with the reporting of the collections account by XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit reporting agencies. I believe the following statutes and codes have been violated : False representation of the character, amount, or legal status of any debt ( 15 USC 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) ).

False representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney ( 15 USC 1692e ( 3 ) ).

False representation or implication that a sale, referral, or other transfer of any interest in a debt shall cause the consumer to lose any claim or defense to payment of the debt ( 15 USC 1692e ( 6 ) ( A ) ).

Use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer ( 15 USC 1692e ( 10 ) ).

False representation or implication that accounts have been turned over to innocent purchasers for value ( 15 USC 1692e ( 12 ) ).

Use or distribution of any written communication that simulates or falsely represents to be a document authorized, issued, or approved by any court, official, or agency of the United States or any State, or which creates a false impression as to its source, authorization, or approval ( 15 USC 1692e ( 9 ) ).

Use of any business, company, or organization name other than the true name of the debt collector 's business, company, or organization ( 15 USC 1692e ( 14 ) ).

Unfair practices under section 808 of the FDCPA. 

It is also worth noting that both Experian and XXXX have informed me that they do not provide a method of verification for past disputes, as required by the FCRA. 

These potential FCRA and FDCPA violations raise concerns about the accuracy, fairness, and legality of the actions taken by XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit reporting agencies. I please ask that the CFPB to find a correction for this.

06/02/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Failure to Receive Promotional Bonus from U.S. Bank Dear Customer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Representative, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to file a formal complaint against U.S. Bank for their failure to provide me with the promised promotional bonus, despite my having met all the specified requirements outlined in their promotional campaign. This issue pertains to a business checking account promotion that promised a significant reward for maintaining a certain deposit over a specified period. 

To summarize, I received an invitation from U.S. Bank on XX/XX/year>, to open a business checking account with the promise of a {$750.00} bonus for depositing {$15000.00} and maintaining it for over 60 days. I promptly met these requirements, only to be later informed that I supposedly did not fulfill another condition not previously communicated to me. 

For your convenience, I have included several attachments with this email : At attached documents include my checking account approved proof screenshot and 6 month bank statement of this account. 

Despite numerous attempts to resolve this issue directly with U.S. Bank, including multiple communications with their customer service department and provision of all requested documentation, my efforts have been fruitless. It has now been several months since I satisfied all promotional criteria, yet the promised bonus remains uncredited. 

This refusal to honor a clear promotional commitment not only constitutes a breach of agreement but also represents a broader issue of trust and integrity within the banking sector. I am therefore reaching out to the CFPB to seek assistance in resolving this matter, ensuring that U.S. Bank is held accountable for their promotional practices. 

I believe the CFPB 's commitment to ensuring fair banking practices and protecting consumer rights positions it uniquely to address and rectify this situation. I am hopeful for your support in securing the promotional bonus rightfully owed to me by U.S. Bank. 

Thank you very much for your attention to this important matter. I am eager for a resolution and remain available should you need any further information or clarification.

14/02/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"The XXXX score system and the credit reporting bureau system in the USA is a XXXX  and desperately needs to be replaced. The system is rigged and it is pathetic that our government doesn't do anything to better protect consumers. I just finished a XXXX  year long XXXX that cost me and my family {$500000.00} from hardworking middle class Americans. The judicial system in America is also pathetic to allow such a waste of assets and do nothing about a person that is a XXXX XXXX and law breaker ( my XXXX  ). The XXXX credit bureaus need to be replaced with a not for profit consumer run institution and my case is a strong case as to why. I was forced to XXXX on my XXXX home ( I had a lien ) to get paid for my house as my XXXX XXXX agreed to pay me in our XXXX decree, but she never paid me and instead she defaulted. I spent my entire retirement savings for the past XXXX  years paying the minimum payments on my maxed out credit cards due to my XXXX trying to preserve my credit rating in the hopes that one day I would be able to buy a home again. My retirement is now gone and I have paid my credit cards twice of what I ever charged on them because they have been XXXX me for 30 % interest for XXXX  years, another XXXX that CFPB needs to do a better job of addressing this loan sharking by credit cards ( the credit cards were not willing to work with me in adjusting the interest rate to something more reasonable ). I am a hard working public school teacher XXXX by the system that our government has made. Finally, I was paid {$120000.00} for my XXXX home ( this is money I should have received years ago ). I used this money to pay off a XXXX private XXXX loan that I had had since 2004 with a balance of {$14000.00}. Then I took out {$25000.00} on a 1 % XXXX year intro APR balance transfer card that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was kind enough to extend the credit to me because of my good payment history even though my existing credit cards were maxed out. This should have helped my credit score because I had {$40000.00} of available credit on credit cards that were maxed out, and the new {$25000.00} line decreased my credit utilization rate. Then I used some of my {$120000.00} to pay off the credit cards I couldn't put on the {$25000.00} balance transfer card. So I paid off another {$13000.00} of credit card debt further decreasing my credit card utilization rate. I also forced my XXXX XXXX to sell our XXXX  home, which I was forced to sign the deed over to her as part of our settlement, but I remained on the mortgage of a home that I didn't even own. So I was able to close a mortgage account for a house that I didn't even own. So now I closed a XXXX loan for {$14000.00} that I was paying 10 % interest on, I paid off {$13000.00} of credit cards that I was paying 30 % interest on, I refinanced the remaining {$25000.00} of credit cards for 1 % interest for a year and 14 % interest thereafter, I got rid of a {$110000.00} mortgage that I didn't even own the house to, so my credit and financial situation has vastly improved in the last XXXX  months and I am much more able to take on healthy debt such as a car loan or a home loan ( both things that I am desperate to do- as I have been driving my XXXX car with almost XXXX miles on it for XXXX years and I need a newer more reliable vehicle and I have been forced to be XXXX since XXXX and live with my parents due to the corrupt court system and incompetent police and incompetent judges. My credit score before I paid off my debts 2 months ago was XXXX with maxed out credit cards paying 30 % interest. After paying off my debts and closing accounts that are just XXXX me dry my credit score dropped over XXXX points to XXXX. I can't even qualify for a conventional mortgage with that credit score and I should have a XXXX score closer to XXXX with the financial situation that I have put myself in. The credit bureaus do not indicate what a good financial custodian I have been, and I was very much considering XXXX.  Maybe now after being treated like this I should have filed for XXXX. It will cost me {$100.00} more dollars a month to finance a house with a credit score of XXXX compared to the score that I should have of XXXX or better. This is a XXXX of our system and pathetic that our government allows good people like me to be taken advantage of by a for profit system that just wants to keep you XXXX. I already missed out on buying a house that I wanted to buy, even though I have the money to buy it with a conventional mortgage, because my XXXX score is so messed up by the credit bureaus. Additionally, the information that is being reported to the credit bureaus is not being updated in a timely manner. I paid for a credit monitoring service ( XXXX ) and on my credit reports they have inaccurate balance information that should be updated on a credit card that I have a {$0.00} balance on saying I have an {$11000.00} balance. What I think is the worst thing is that the XXXX major credit bureaus are allowed to XXXX up someone's financial life by having a XXXX score system that is so incompetently corrupt and does not reflect truth or reality of someone's financial health. I am WAY more financially healthy and able to take on healthy debt now with a XXXX of XXXX than I was XXXX months ago with a XXXX of XXXX. The XXXX scoring system needs to be overhauled and the XXXX for profit credit bureaus need to be replaced with a not for profit consumer run agency. I have been the epitomy of a GREAT American trying to do everything right, and I have been royally XXXX by the system that our government has allowed to thrive. I expect the CFPB to use my situation as an example as to why the XXXX credit bureaus and XXXX score system should be eliminated.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So, whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft. This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 15 USC 1681o, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.

I am writing to formally request the removal of a late payment entry associated with my account XXXX under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 


According to 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, creditors have an obligation to report accurate information to credit reporting agencies. I believe that the late payments were reported on XX/XX/year> does not accurately reflect my payment history, and therefore violates this provision. 


Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1666b and 15 U.S. Code 1681i, I have the right to dispute any inaccuracies and to have them investigated. I request that you review my payment history and consider removing the late payment from my credit report. I have always valued my relationship with XXXX  and have made all my payments on time, except for this instance, which I have identified several factors that suggest an error in the reporting process : Timely Payments : I have consistently made on-time payments throughout the life of the loan, and I have documentation that supports this. The late payment reported for XX/XX/year> does not align with my payment history, which indicates no missed or late payments prior to this instance. 
Payment Processing Delay : The payment for XX/XX/year> was submitted within the required timeframe, but there may have been an internal delay in processing, leading to the incorrect reporting of a late payment.

Dispute Already Filed : I had previously filed a dispute regarding this issue, which was marked as resolved. However, the inaccurate late payment entry remains on my credit report, which has negatively impacted my credit score.

I kindly ask that you provide me with a response to this request within 30 days. Should you find that the information reported is incorrect, I would appreciate your assistance in correcting it with the credit reporting agencies. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

I have made several attempts to report and have fraudulent items removed from my credit file. However, despite my efforts and numerous notifications, these items continue to exist unabated.

Implement robust measures to prevent further occurrences of fraudulent items and ensure the security of customer accounts and data.

Provide clear and timely communication to affected customers, including updates on the status of investigations and actions taken to address the issue.

Offer appropriate compensation or restitution to customers who have been adversely affected by the presence of fraudulent items, such as refunds or account credits.

Review and improve your customer support and complaint resolution procedures to ensure that issues are addressed promptly and effectively in the future.

Account Information : Creditor 's Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dates of Late Payments : XX/XX/XXXX Nature of Complaint : I submitted a dispute to Experian disputing a late payment reported by XXXX  I referenced the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) ( 15 U.S. Code 1637 ( b ) ) in my dispute, explaining that the reported late payment was inaccurate for the following reasons : Payment Delay Due to a Bank Transfer Error : My payment for XX/XX/XXXX was initiated on time. However, a processing error on my bank 's end delayed the transfer by 24 hours. I provided bank statements and transfer confirmation showing the exact date the payment was initiated and the error acknowledged by my bank. 
System Outage on Payment Portal : During the period in question, XXXX experienced an outage on their online payment portal, which prevented me from making a timely payment through the usual online process. I contacted customer service immediately after the issue and have attached screenshots of my conversation with their support team confirming the technical outage. 
Incorrect Late Payment Assignment : The late payment was incorrectly applied to my account even though my payment history shows that I have consistently made on-time payments. There was no valid reason for the assignment of a late fee or the reporting of this late payment, and I have attached payment receipts that show consistent payments for the past two years.

Despite providing this information and adhering to the dispute process within the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Experian has failed to resolve this matter satisfactorily or remove the inaccurate late payment from my credit report.

As a consumer, I have rights under the FCRA and TILA, including the right to accurate credit reporting. The continued presence of this inaccurate information is negatively impacting my credit score and financial well-being.

Requested Resolution : I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that credit reporting agencies adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Truth in Lending Act. 

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your prompt response regarding the investigation of my complaint.

Details of the Complaint : 1.The FDCPA Violation : Despite my multiple attempts to communicate with XXXX regarding a disputed alleged debt, I have received no response whatsoever. This complete disregard for the FDCPA 's requirement to address consumer disputes in a timely manner is unacceptable. 
2. The FCRA Violation : According to the FCRA, any entity that fails to respond to a dispute within 30 days must delete the disputed item from the consumer report. However, XXXX refusal to acknowledge my disputes and their failure to act within the legally mandated time frame goes against this crucial consumer protection legislation. 

I have made several attempts to resolve this matter directly with XXXX, but their lack of response has left me with no alternative but to escalate my complaint to you.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NV,89102,,Consent provided,Web,14/02/24,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8335555,0

I have demonstrated my commitment to resolving the issue in good faith. 

To my surprise and dismay, I recently discovered that the charge-off has been removed from my account without any explanation or communication from your end. This unilateral decision has left me in a state of uncertainty and confusion, as it directly impacts my credit history and financial reputation. 

I demand immediate clarification and justification for the removal of the charge-off from my account. It is imperative that Credit Bureaus provides transparent and accountable reasons for this action, as it has far-reaching implications for my financial well-being. 

Furthermore, I request that you promptly reinstate the charge-off on my account unless you can provide compelling evidence and rationale for its removal. This matter must be resolved in a fair and equitable manner, taking into account my rights as a customer and the principles of accountability and transparency. 

I expect a timely response to this complaint and a satisfactory resolution to the issues raised.

XXXX and Experian, recognized as consumer reporting agencies, interface directly with consumers like me. I, as the consumer, possess the fundamental right to safeguard my private information from unwarranted sharing, as substantiated by 15 USC 6801, which underscores Congress 's stance that each financial institution bears an ongoing obligation to uphold the privacy of its clientele and safeguard the confidentiality of their nonpublic personal data.

Entities furnishing information to credit agencies are categorized as financial institutions under the aforementioned statute. Pertinently, 15 USC 1681, section 604a, subsection 2 outlines that consumer reporting agencies may solely furnish consumer reports in adherence to the explicit written directives of the concerned consumer. Both the financial institution, as the provider of information to credit agencies, and the consumer reporting agencies such as XXXX and Experian, and XXXX, do not possess my authorization to furnish this information, nor do they have my explicit written consent. Therefore, any consent previously extended to XXXX, Experian, XXXX, or other entities acting as furnishers of information to credit agencies, whether verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, is hereby revoked. 
Moreover, 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) dictates that a financial institution must not disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties unless the consumer is provided with a clear explanation of how they can exercise their right to non-disclosure. Regrettably, the financial institution in question failed to inform me of my right to exercise this option. Additionally, as per 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ), no consumer reporting agency may include certain adverse items of information in a consumer report without proper authorization, a provision this account infringes upon.

Under 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ), entities are prohibited from furnishing inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies, yet XXXX and Experian continue to do so. Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that consumer reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to prevent violations of section 1681c and restrict the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes specified under section 1681b, a requirement which XXXX and Experian seem to neglect. 
Additionally, as outlined in 12 CFR 1016.7, consumers retain the right to opt out of reporting services at any given time.

These late payments are erroneous and do not accurately reflect my payment history.

Nature of the Complaint : Inaccurate Reporting : The late payment listed on my credit report for XXXX XXXX is inaccurate. I have consistently made my payments on time, as I have been enrolled in autopay for all my accounts.

Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The inaccurate reporting of these late payments violates my rights under the FCRA ( 15 USC 1666 ( b ) ), as they misrepresent my creditworthiness.

Potential Violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : The reporting of false late payments may also constitute a violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from misrepresentation regarding their accounts.

Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : The reporting practices violate the TILA, which mandates accurate reporting of credit information.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) mandates that credit reporting agencies and information furnishers correct any inaccurate or incomplete information and ensure maximum accuracy of consumer files. Additionally, the FCRA provides for civil liability under 15 USC 1681n and 1681o for willful and negligent noncompliance. 
Requested Resolution : I request that TransUnion conduct a thorough investigation and remove the inaccurate late payment for XXXX XXXX from my credit report. I expect written confirmation of the correction within 30 days of this complaint. Failure to resolve this matter may result in further action to protect my rights as a consumer under the FCRA.

The FCRA requires that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of the information they report ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Repeatedly reporting the charge-off each month results in a misleading and inaccurate credit report, which has significantly harmed my credit score.

I recently disputed several accounts on my credit report under the claim of identity theft, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2. I submitted a Police Report and an FTC identity theft report ( FTC Report Number : XXXX ) as evidence. The credit bureau acknowledged my dispute but has not complied with the requirements set forth by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
Despite my initial request for the blocking of these fraudulent items, the following account remain on my credit report : 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX - ACCOUNT NUMBERXXXX DateOpened:XX/XX/XXXX Date Report : XX/XX/XXXX.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( 7 ) - Description of Investigation : Pursuant to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are obligated to provide a description of the investigation within 15 days of receiving a consumer 's dispute. To date, I have not received this required information.

15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ) - Verification Requirement : Per the FCRA, you are required by federal law to verify all accounts and public information through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ). Without such verification, there is a risk that erroneous or fraudulent information could be included in credit reports.

If the information can not be verified, per 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ), I request that you delete any unverifiable information.

Failure to Investigate Accurately ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) : After submitting a dispute regarding inaccuracies on my credit report, I did not receive a thorough investigation within the mandated 30-day timeframe. The results of the investigation did not adequately address my concerns.

According to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, credit reporting agencies are required to block disputed information identified as resulting from identity theft within four business days of receiving a valid identity theft report. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 609 ( a ) ( 2 ) and 1681i ( 7 ), any unverifiable or inaccurate information must be removed from my credit report.

Inadequate Compliance Procedures ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) ) : The bureau has not demonstrated that it has implemented reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided on my report. I am requesting detailed information on the procedures used during the investigation.

RE : You violated the United States Code Law 15 U.S Code 1681 a ( 4 ) Consumer Right to privacy You are reporting fraudulent accounts that aren't actually mine, which is an infringement of my privacy. Congress said I have the right to decide what I deem private. I deem my hard inquiry and account information to be private and I DO NOT WANT THIS INFORMATION SHARED ON MY CREDIT REPORT. FDCPA 807 misleading false reporting THE INFORMATION YOU ARE REPORTING WOULD LEAD A FUTURE CREDITOR TO BELIEVE I APPLIED FOR ALL THESE INQUIRIES & accounts, when in reality it wasn't me, it was a scammer. Reporting these false things is very misleading. You are in violation because you did not witness me sign for these inquiries or accounts, so you can't actually verify that they are accurate, but yet you still reported these things to my credit report which goes against the FCRA laws for FAIRNESS. 15 USC 1681 n Civil liability for willful noncompliance You willfully accepted this credit information about me without verifying with your own two eyes that it was me who applied for this credit. Willful compliance is punishable up to { {$1000.00} } per violation. 18 U.S. Code 1028A - Aggravated identity theft You shared my information with numerous creditors without getting my consent first. you are criminally liable for aggravated identity theft which is punishable for up to 2 years. 15 U.S. Code 6802 ( b ) 1 ( ) ( a ) ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) - Obligations with respect to disclosures of personal information DIDN'T DISCLOSE TO ME THAT I HAD THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS INFORMATION BEING SHARED. THAT WAS VERY deceptive OF YOU. You never explained to me that I can exercise a nondisclosure option. I feel like my consumer rights have been violated, and I have been taken advantage of. FDCPA 8012 furnishing deceptive forms You furnished these inaccurate inquiries and accounts as if they were accurate when they were never validated according to GAAP, so you don't even know if these accounts are accurate, but yet you still took it upon yourself to report this inaccurate information. Also, you reported that I owe a 'debt ', but nowhere on my credit report do I see a Negative balance, ( I don't see a negative sign in front of any numbers, only positive ). By you telling me I owe a "" debt '', but reporting positive balances to my credit report is very deceptive. 15 U.S. Code 1692f. Unfair practices A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law. There is no law that says I have to pay a bill. Using any language or symbol, other than the debt collector 's address, on any envelope when communicating with a consumer by use of the mails or by telegram, except that a debt collector may use his business name if such name does not indicate that he is in the debt collection business. This company sent letters to me with a LOGO on it instead of their address. That is a SYMBOL that they are a debt Collection business. 15 U.S. Code 1602 - Definitions and rules of construction ( e ) The term "" person '' means a natural person or an organization. ( f ) The term "" credit '' means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment. Under 15 USC 1681s-2 this agency is in violation because they furnished information relating to me to the consumer that was inaccurate. I told them that this was inaccurate and they still reported it to my credit report. I AM THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR AND I DO NOT GRANT YOU THE RIGHT TO DEFER ANY PAYMENTS TO ME. 15 U.S Code 1681 a ( 4 ) Consumer Right to privacy You are reporting very private matters on my credit report. The FCRA says that the consumer has sole say so over matters I deem to be private to me. I happen to find matters about where I APPLIED TO, AND WHO I "" OWE '' MONEY TO, to be very private. By you sharing this information, I have developed a very bad Paranoia that I have to take medication for. You are liable for all damages that I suffered because of your illegal activities. FDCPA 806 harassment in abuse I feel very harassed and abused by your actions. I already contacted the creditors and told them that these accounts were inaccurate, but they still reported negatively to my credit report without my consent. Every time I log in and check my credit report and see these inaccurate items on my credit report, I feel much abused. Creditors keep calling and sending letters to me about these mysterious "" debts ' that are not validated by the original creditor, which makes me feel very harassed. Section 1581a ( 3 ) defines Identity Theft as fraud committed using identifying information of another person. These creditors illegally obtained my information without my true consent and they obtained credit from other financial institutions using my information.

Timing of payments Nowhere in the TILA, FCRA, FDCPA does it define a Late Payment, but yet you are reporting "" late payments '' to my credit report. that is very inaccurate and deceptive.

Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The use or threat of violence or other criminal means to harm the physical person, reputation, or property of any person.

I request the return of those payments to be mailed to me by check. 15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts 1 am the original creditor, ONLY I CAN VALIDATE ANY DEBTS. I do not validate these debts or accounts. You tried to trick me into thinking you are the original creditor when in reality, ONLY I CAN EXTEND CREDIT so therefore I am the original creditor.

I've already lost a lot of time on the phone with them, open dispute, calls that are disconnected and the last straw was last week when my lender informed me that I wouldn't get a loan because Experian doesn't have my score and my credit is over XXXX with XXXX and XXXX. Every time I call Experian it's a different excuse. Today, for example, they said it was XXXX 's fault that it didn't report it to Experian. I called the XXXX company and there they informed me that this can only be an excuse from Experian and that XXXX doesn't report anything to anyone. When I financed a car last year my interest was higher because, again, the dealer I was unable to obtain my records with Experian.

It says that companies like XXXX and XXXX, which share people 's financial information, must be fair and respect my privacy. Another law, 15 USC 6801, says that financial institutions, like the ones sharing my information, have to protect my privacy. I don't want them to share my information, and they need my permission to do so. Even if they had my permission before, I'm taking it back now. 15 USC 6802 says that a financial institution can't share my private information unless they explain how I can say no. They never told me I could say no. Moreover, another law, 15 USC 1681C, says that they can't share negative information about me without my permission. But they're doing it anyway, which is against the law. There are more laws, like 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 and 15 U.S. Code 1681e, that say companies like XXXX and XXXX must be careful and accurate when sharing information. But it seems like they're not following those rules. One more thing, according to 12 CFR 1016.7, I can choose not to let them share my information at any time. So, I'm choosing not to let them do it anymore. Thank you for understanding.

06/02/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Ive noticed that several deviations from mandatory reporting standards therefore the data in my report can not be accurate and complete! With that said, I deny your allegations and I challenge you to provide proof that you have the right to report this incomplete negative information on my credit report.

Per 15 U.S.C 1681e Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

According to 12 CFR Part 1022 ( Regulation V ) requires furnishers to : Furnish information concerning accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity.

Furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate.

C - Conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes According to XXXX, in order to make a lawful report, you must follow the Metro 2 compliance standards. 

Also as stated in the XXXX Any Deviation From These Standards Jeopardizes The Integrity of The Data. This means that any mistakes in reporting claims can make the information less accurate and it affects the accuracy of any federally regulated reports.

Therefore, I am invoking my rights to challenge these inaccurate and non-compliant items. Neglecting my demand will only prove that you DO NOT care about my rights as a consumer. Its NOT FAIR for you to report information that isnt confirmed to be ethical and meets the standards of certified reporting. Again, I am challenging these claims and asking for proof of the proper reporting standards.

You are violating my rights! I have listed the concerns about your reporting in this document. It's not complete and does not meet my standards according to law, you must certify all aspects of required FCRA/ Metro 2 compliance which is done truthfully, correctly ( in a timely manner ), completely AND accurately as well - or else I would have to escalate these issues to the CFPB , FTC and my Attorney General.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,349XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/02/24,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8294609,0
