# Consumer-Financial-Protection-Bureau-Complaints-
The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products.

 

Summary of Clustering Results
Using K-Means clustering on a database of credit reporting complaints by customers, three different clusters were obtained. The clusters differ in size and content orientation:
Cluster 0: 420 complaints
Cluster 1: 58 complaints
Cluster 2: 142 grievances
Each cluster was identified by the analysis of the most common words and overall style of the stories within the complaints.




Cluster Analysis & Inferences
Cluster 1: "Infringements of Privacy Rights"
Complaint Number: 58 complaints
Essential Terminology and Juridical Citations:
Multiple complaints consistently refer to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), citing in particular provisions like 15 U.S.C. 1681, namely section 602 A and section 604 A.
The language is cantered on privacy, confidentiality, and federally guarded consumer rights.
Content Focus:
The consumers in this group are complaining that their privacy rights are being infringed.
The grievances indicate that consumers are well aware of their legal rights and are specifically invoking some FCRA provisions to request improved treatment.
Inference & Justification:
Inference: This type of category captures grievances that center on mishandling of personal information and confidentiality breaches.
Rationale for the Naming: Considering the number of legal citations and emphasis on privacy rights, naming this collection "Privacy Right Violations" most aptly serves the general direction of the grievance being lodged by the customers here.




Cluster 0: "General Credit Report Disputes"
Complaint Count: 420 complaints
Key Phrases and Themes:
The terms used here are more general and encompass such words as inaccurate accounts, dispute, correction, and consumer report.
Complaints are narrative in form, describing the discovery of credit report errors.
Content Focus:
These complaints usually involve disputes regarding misinformation or outdated information found on credit reports.
They are a general issue where customers are requesting rectification of mistakes without necessarily invoking particular legal codes.
Inference & Justification:
Inference: The predominant issue within this cluster pertains to the rectification of inaccuracies present in credit reports.
Rationale for Designation: Given the fact that these complaints are directed towards numerous errors found in credit reports and the overall necessity of disputing erroneous facts, the label "General Credit Report Disputes" is a precise encapsulation of the overall nature of these consumer complaints.

Cluster 2: "Fraudulent/Unauthorized Reporting"
Complaint Number: 142 complaints
Key Phrases and Themes:
Common terms employed are block, unauthorized, and fraudulent.
Many complaints often suggest that the credit report contains information that is not only inaccurate but perhaps also fraudulent, with some victims reporting that they feel misrepresented or deceived.
Content Focus:
Consumers express particular concern for reports that they view as coming from fraud schemes or improper reporting.
These complaints come with an urgency to them since customers demand to have such details erased from their credit reports with immediate effect.
Inference & Justification:
Inference: This group is defined by its focus on cases where consumers feel their credit data has been changed or inappropriately reported because of fraud.
Justification for the Name: The focus on fraud-related terms and the request for blocking of erroneous information squarely justify the title "Fraudulent/Unauthorized Reporting."

Summary of Conclusions
Different Customer Issues:
The cluster analysis demonstrates that, though a large proportion of complaints (Cluster 0) pertains to general inaccuracies and dispute resolution processes, there are other categories where consumers are highly concerned about privacy invasions (Cluster 1) and misleading reporting processes (Cluster 2).

Targeted Interventions:
Violations of Privacy Rights (Cluster 1):
Could involve stronger enforcement of data protection and clearer treatment of sensitive credit data.
Complaints Regarding General Credit Reports (Cluster 0):
Suggests a need for improved processes to rectify widespread errors, potentially by refining verification processes.
Fraudulent/Unauthorized Reporting (Cluster 2): 
Implies that adopting additional fraud detection measures and streamlining dispute resolution procedures can reduce consumer worry. 
Legal awareness and consumer empowerment: 
The fact that Cluster 1 contains broad legal guidelines and Cluster 2 contains specific fraud complaints indicates a very high level of consumer knowledge. This information may be valuable in providing insight into credit bureaus and regulatory agencies regarding the exact areas where consumers show significant expertise—and perhaps disgruntlement—regarding current practices.
